#1a Describe the data 
#The males shoe size and height are bigger/higher than the females.

#1b Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result?

male_shoeH <- subset(Household_Data, Gender == "M")

female_shoeH <- subset(Household_Data, Gender == "F")

#1c  Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result

meanshoeSH <- mean(Household_Data$Shoe_size&Household_Data$Height)
meanshoeSH


#1d Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?

#Yes. The higher the height, the bigger the shoe size

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector
summary(Monthsss)
summary(factor_months_vector)
#The result discplayed how mony of the same months are there in the vector and also displayed its data types. Yes they are both useful.
