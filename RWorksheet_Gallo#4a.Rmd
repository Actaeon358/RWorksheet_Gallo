#1a Describe the data 
#The males shoe size and height are bigger/higher than the females.

#1b Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result?

male_shoeH <- subset(Household_Data, Gender == "M")

female_shoeH <- subset(Household_Data, Gender == "F")

#1c  Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result

meanshoeSH <- mean(Household_Data$Shoe_size&Household_Data$Height)
meanshoeSH


#1d Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?

#Yes. The higher the height, the bigger the shoe size

Monthsss <- c("March","April","January","November","January","September","October","September","November","August","January","November","November","February","May","August","July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
factor_months_vector <- factor(Monthsss)
factor_months_vector


#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector
summary(Monthsss)
summary(factor_months_vector)
#The result discplayed how mony of the same months are there in the vector and also displayed its data types. Yes they are both useful.

#4 Create a vector and factor for the table below.

Direction <- c("East","West","North")
Frequency <- c(1,4,3)

factorDirect <- factor(Direction)
factorFreq <- factor(Frequency)

new_order_data <- factor(factorDirect,levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(new_order_data)

new_order_data2 <- factor(factorFreq,levels = c(1,4,3))
print(new_order_data2)

#5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv

ExcelData <- read.csv("import_march.csv")
