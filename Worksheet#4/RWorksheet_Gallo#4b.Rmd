```{r}
#1 . Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.
vectorA <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
matrixa <- matrix(vectorA, nrow = 5,ncol = 5)

vectora <-c(0)
matrixA <- matrix(0, nrow =5,ncol =5)

for (i in length(vectorA)) {
  matrixA[i, ] <- abs(vectorA-vectorA[i])
}
print(matrixA)

```
```{r}
#2 Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown in Figur

for(i in 1:5 ){
  newstar <- rep("*",i)
  print(newstar)
}

```
```{r}
#3 Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.
