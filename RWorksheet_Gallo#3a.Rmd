## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#code here

#1 
LETTERS
letters

#Based on the above vector LETTERS:
#1a Produce first 11 letters
Letter11 <- LETTERS[1:11]
Letter11
#1b Contains odd numbered letters
AllLetters <- LETTERS
LetterOdd <- AllLetters[seq(1, length(AllLetters), by = 2)]
LetterOdd

#1c Produce Vowels
LetterVow <- c("A","E","I","O","U")
LetterVow

#Based on the above vector letters:
#1d Last 5 lowercase letters
letter5 <- letters[22:26]
letter5
#1e Contains letters between 15 to 24
fifteen23 <-letters[16:23]
fifteen23

#2 Create a vector(not a dataframe) with the average temperatures in April for Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.
AverageTemperaturesApril = c(42, 39, 34, 34, 30, 27)
AverageTemperaturesApril
